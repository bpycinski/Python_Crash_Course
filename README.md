# How The Internet Works - A Year 7 project

## Intro
You can use this project from [GitHub Pages](http://marcscott.github.io/How_the_internet_works/#/), but the video's will not work in I.E
You can also access the project at [Coding2Learn](http://www.coding2learn.org) in the Resources section of the site.
Alternatively feel free to fork the project or download a zip file.
This project is designed to be self-paced, but the instructor may wish to set targets for students to complete each section.
An outline of potential milestones is provided below.
Accompanying the presentation are several quizzes using [Socrative](http://www.socrative.com), for which you will need to sign up (it's free)

## Getting started
Open up the index.html to start the project. I recommend this is made available to the students rather than being presented to them.
The project license (see LICENSE.md) is open, so feel free to remove the logos

## Proposed outline (untested as yet - will be updated)
